## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/default-detection.git```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Open the command prompt or terminal.

5. Run the main script with the provided test data.
```python main.py NBKI_test.zip```

This will generate predictions and metrics for default detection.

## Results

The results of my initial model are displayed in the provided notebooks.

## TODO list

Future steps for this project may include:

- Hyperparameter tuning for the models.
- Feature engineering and selection to improve predictive performance.
- Implementing techniques to address class imbalance
    - Undersampling
    - Oversampling
    - Synthetic data generation
- Deep analysis
